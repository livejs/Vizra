# VizraVid

### Welcome to VizraVid.

>VizraVid is a piece of software which analyses audio and mixes two video elements based on the output

*N.B.* I (Ruth/@Rumyra) created VizraVid for myself. It's been through a few versions, but I've settled on it _just doing one thing_. There's a suite of Vizra software, this one is for video mixing.

This is the joy of code, that we can create bespoke software to satisfy our own needs. And it is useful none the less, feel free to poke around the code, use it and ask any questions.

#### Set up

Run it on a local server, like python simple server, or I like http-server (node module).
